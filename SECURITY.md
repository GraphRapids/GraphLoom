## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities privately. Do not open public GitHub issues for security problems.

1. Use GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting:
   `https://github.com/Faerkeren/GraphLoom/security/advisories/new`
2. If that form is unavailable, create a private security advisory from the repository Security tab and invite `@Faerkeren`.

Include as much detail as possible:
- Affected version or commit SHA
- Reproduction steps or proof of concept
- Impact and likely attack scenario
- Suggested mitigation (if known)

## Response Timeline

- Within 2 business days: acknowledgement of receipt
- Within 5 business days: triage and severity assessment
- Within 14 calendar days: remediation plan or temporary mitigation
- Every 7 days after triage: status updates until resolution

## Disclosure Policy

Please allow time for a fix before public disclosure.
After a patch is released, maintainers will coordinate advisory publication and release notes.
